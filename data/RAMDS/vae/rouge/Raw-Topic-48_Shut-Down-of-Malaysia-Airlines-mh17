U.S. intelligence assessments suggest that Russia provided separatists in eastern Ukraine with sophisticated antiaircraft systems in recent weeks , including the missile that brought down a Malaysia Airlines plane , killing all 298 aboard , two senior U.S. officials told Fox News late Saturday .
Crisis and risk management expert Kuniyoshi Shirai at A.C.E. Consulting in Tokyo said Malaysia Airlines must take dramatic steps such as replacing top executives in response to the disaster , which he blamed partly on the airline for flying over war-torn eastern Ukraine .
Even though there were no restrictions , Malaysia Airlines may still face questions about why it continued with flight paths over eastern Ukraine at the heart of a violent rebellion against Kiev when some airlines decided months ago to change routes to skip around the area .
Aviation authorities in several countries , including the FAA in the United States , had issued warnings not to fly over parts of Ukraine prior to Thursday 's crash , but many carriers , including cash-strapped Malaysia Airlines , had continued to use the route because `` it is a shorter route , which means less fuel and therefore less money , '' said aviation expert Norman Shanks .
