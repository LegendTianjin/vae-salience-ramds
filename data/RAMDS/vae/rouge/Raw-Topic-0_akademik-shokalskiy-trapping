They were flown by helicopter from the MV Akademik Shokalskiy to an ice floe next to Australian icebreaker the Aurora Australis , and then taken by a small boat to the vessel .
The twin-rotor helicopter , based on a Chinese icebreaker , the Xue Long , or Snow Dragon , flew several sorties across miles of packed ice to pluck scientists , tourists and journalists from a landing zone next to the marooned vessel , the Akademik Shokalskiy .
In a dramatic operation displaying unusual international harmony in one of the world s most remote and inhospitable places , a red-and-white Chinese helicopter on Thursday rescued 52 passengers trapped for more than a week aboard an icebound Russian research ship in Antarctica , ferrying them a dozen at a time to an Australian icebreaker .
Australia 's maritime authority said the Aurora Australis , a vessel designed to break through thick blocks of ice , had come close to the MV Akademik Shokalskiy , a Russian ship that remains stranded after two earlier rescue attempts by other icebreakers failed .
